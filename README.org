* Producer Consumer lab
  This lab required to implent a program that would take, conver and display a vidio which would be done using threads in a asyncrounous way
* requirements
  the lab requires the image has 3 ways to implement
  - extract the frame from a file
  - convert each frame to grayscale
  - display the image 
* implementations
    My aproach was to take the image and put every step on a thread and running
  them simlutatiously. the problem is that the process uses the same data which
  would cause a race condition.
    Using semaphores for an aproach on producer consumer for each of the 
  steps. The steps  would behave as a producer and a consumer at the same
  time. Using a semaphore for handling converted frames into grayscale.
  and a semaphore for handling the displaying the "grayscaled" image.
